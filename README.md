# AGS

CLI around [Astal](https://github.com/aylur/astal) to scaffold and run projects.
Astal is a set of libraries written in Vala/C that makes writing a Desktop Shell easy.
It also has an accompanying JavaScript library which lets you write Desktop Shells in JSX running on GJS.
GJS is a JavaScript runtime built on Firefox's SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine and the GNOME platform libraries, the same runtime [GNOME Shell](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell) runs on.
